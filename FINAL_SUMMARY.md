## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Issue: Don't see [EnrollMate] logs
**Solutions:**
1. Reload extension (click reload in chrome://extensions/)
2. Make sure F12 console is open BEFORE clicking Extract
3. Check you're on a course listing page
4. Try the other logging method (popup vs. page)

### Issue: See "Found 0 courses"
**Solutions:**
1. Check if page has HTML tables with course data
2. Try with example_data/example_1.html to verify it works
3. Page might use JavaScript rendering (wait for page to load)
4. See DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md for detailed troubleshooting

### Issue: Course data looks incomplete
**Solutions:**
1. Expand the `[Array(X)]` to see full fields
2. Check schedule, enrollment, and instructor fields
3. Compare extracted data with what's on the page
4. Adjust CSS selectors if needed

---

## Two Ways to View Logs

### Way 1: Course Extraction Logs (F12 on Page)
```
1. Open course page
2. Press F12
3. Go to Console tab
4. Click extension icon → Extract Courses
5. See [EnrollMate] messages with course details
```
**Best for:** Seeing raw extraction data and debugging

### Way 2: Communication Logs (Inspect Popup)
```
1. Click extension icon (opens popup)
2. Right-click popup → "Inspect"
3. Go to Console tab
4. Click "Extract Courses"
5. See [EnrollMate Popup] messages
6. See console.table() with all courses
```
**Best for:** Seeing popup-to-extension communication and formatted tables

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Test Now)

2. ✅ Open a course page or example_data/example_1.html
3. ✅ Press F12 and extract courses
4. ✅ Verify you see detailed logs in console
5. ✅ Check course data looks correct

### Short-term (Phase 4 - Backend)
6. Build the 3 required API endpoints:

   - `GET /api/users/{id}/semesters`
   - `POST /api/semesters/{id}/import-courses`
7. Update `ENROLLMATE_API_URL` in `utils/config.js`
8. Test full authentication and import workflow

### Long-term (Phase 5-6)
9. Add support for more university systems
10. Implement advanced features (progress tracking, retry logic)
11. Polish UI and add React framework
12. Test and deploy to Chrome Web Store
